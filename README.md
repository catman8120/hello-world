# hello-world
New to Github, long time coder / hardware tinkerer!
I have many years experience with microprocessors and microcontrollers.  
Started back in the late 70's with intel 8080 and Z80.
Built a few clones from parts in the day.
Currently playing with arduinos, specifically the ESP8266. Cool gadget! Still learning!
I have an old Sears battery charger that the controller died, I am replacing the smarts with an ESP8266 and a microchip pic.
